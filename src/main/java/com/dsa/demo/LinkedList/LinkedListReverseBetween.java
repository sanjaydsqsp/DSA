///LL: Reverse Between ( ** Interview Question)
//⚠️ Advanced Challenge Alert: Linked List Mastery!
//
//Welcome to what many consider the pinnacle of Linked List challenges in this course! This exercise is not just a test of your coding skills, but also a measure of your problem-solving ability and understanding of complex data structures.
//
//Here's how you can tackle it:
//
//Visualize the Problem: Before diving into coding, grab a pen and paper. Sketch out the linked list and visualize each step of the process. This approach isn't just for beginners; it's exactly how seasoned developers plan their attack on complex problems.
//
//Seek Understanding Over Speed: Take your time to really grasp each part of the problem. The goal here is deep understanding, not just a quick solution. If you find yourself stuck, that's a part of the learning process.
//
//It's Okay to Take a Break: Feel free to step away from this challenge and return later. This course is designed to equip you with a growing set of skills, and sometimes, a bit of distance can bring new insights.
//
//Approach Like a Pro: Remember, facing a challenging problem is what being a professional developer is all about. Use this exercise to think, plan, and code like a pro.
//
//
//
//Now, let's dive into the exercise:
//
//___________________________________
//
//
//
//In the LinkedList class, implement a method called reverseBetween that reverses the nodes of the list between indexes startIndex and endIndex (inclusive).
//
//It's important to note that you should only rearrange the nodes themselves, not just their values.
//
//Note:  The Linked List does NOT have a tail which will make the implementation easier.
//
//Assumption: You can assume that startIndex and endIndex are not out of bounds.
//
//The method should have the following signature:
//
//
//
//public void reverseBetween(int m, int n) {
//    // Your implementation here
//}
//
//
//The method should not return any value, and it should modify the original linked list.
//
//The positions startIndex and endIndex are 0-indexed.
//
//
//
//Example:
//
//Given the following linked list:
//
//
//
//1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
//
//
//
//Calling reverseBetween(1, 3) should result in the following modified linked list:
//
//
//
//1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5
//
//
//
//I highly recommend that you draw the Linked List out on a piece of paper so you can visualize the steps.
//
//Notes:
//
//The method should not duplicate any of the existing nodes, only rearranging the existing nodes in the list.
//
//However, the creation of a limited number of new nodes is allowed (e.g., dummy nodes to facilitate the partitioning process).
//
//The method should not use any extra data structures such as arrays or lists.
